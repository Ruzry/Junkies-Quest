# Junkies-Quest
2D Action Adventure Game

This is a small project I am playing with as a way to get reaquanted with C++, the idea is to be a short game with a couple quests illistrating some of the wacky encounters I have experienced living in Scotland.

64bit C++ project with SFML compiled with gcc using minGW.
